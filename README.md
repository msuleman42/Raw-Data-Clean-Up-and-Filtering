# Raw-Data-Clean-Up-and-Filtering
Starting with the dirtycv.txt file, the aim was to clean/reformat the data and write it into another file. From there this file is read and the candidates were filtered based on their experience and qualifications. Candidates suitable for the job are presented in a .csv file.
